# Manning Tutorial

This directory contains a basic fortran project on the evolution of
tsunami waves using the concept of shallow water equations. This is also
a basic introduction to the use of the Fortran Package manager (fpm) and
using the python script for visualising the system.

It is based on the exercise of Chapter2 of the book "Modern Fortran" by
*Milan Curcic*
